MoniGarr experiments with Android Annotations.

# Why Android Annotations?

- improves code inspection
- simple auto-generated classes
- name-based dependency injection
- super fast build time duplication of all required activities
- pushes connection logic into the required activities
- injects both state and layout into an activity
- Dependency Injection (views, extras, system services, resources...)
- Simplified Threading Model (annotated methods will execute on UI thread or background thread)
- Event Binding (handle events on views)
- REST client (generates implementation for client interface)
- Generates subclasses at compile time
- less than 150kb
- no runtime perf impact
